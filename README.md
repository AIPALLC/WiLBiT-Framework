# WiLBiT-Framework
WiLBiT is a free .NET UI Framework created &amp; developed with C# to replace all other paid .NET UI Framework Components such as Bunifu, Guna UI, etc. 

# WiLBiT Source code
WiLBiT is unfortunately not open-source, it is not free to modify but it will have a few code leaks to help out and motivate other .NET UI Framework creators in the future.
